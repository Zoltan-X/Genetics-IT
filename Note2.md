## Considerations about this ...

### Basics from Digital Flip-Flop mechanisms

First of all, 
the fundamental approach of abstracting all kind of programming languages,  
has to be broken down to the basics of digital processing and  
therefore to Flip-Flop mechanisms.

**All digital circuit logics are realized with Flip-Flop circuits!**

Therefore the fundamental basics  
of all programming languages  
are abstracted to Flip-Flop logics.

As defined in previous [Note.md]  
there are seemingly only two Operations  
A. Flip Bit
A. Compare A Equal B Branching
with a Flow-Direction determined as Spin Left or Right  
for Information structures wider than a single bit.

This is resulting in a minimum Set of:

1. Flip Addressed Information Bit
2. Compare A EQUAL B Branching
3. Flow Direction with SPIN L|R Low- or Big-Endian System

Additionally for functional Programming:

1. Call Function
2. Return Result from Function

And finally:

1. Information Addressing in Form of Duplicate A to B with   
   A Immediate|Register|Memory and  
   B Register|Memory
   * Get A is dup A to B
   * Put A is dup A to B
   
The abstraction and depending associations to Genetics therefore  
are far more complex caused by several circumstances.

1. There is the special molecular chain structure from DNA and RNA to be considered.  
   It is of fundamental dependency for the genetic mechanics.  
   + There are 
     + the double Helix form of DNA  
        + The partial Sequences, which are (in)activated for reproductions.  
     + The Telomerase Limitations  
     + The Amino pairings and permutations  
   + The Complex of spatial structure definitions  
     * How is it determined that RNA is bending and bonding to itself  
       in a such useful manor,  
       as it defines thereby all applicable structure of cell growth.  
     * Determination of spatially evolving structures with  
       * Nucleus and  
       * Cell borders.  
2. The way how proteins and other cells are build through     
   * Fluid bonding     
   * molecular structural bending of RNA   
   * the Four stages that are known for different stages in Cell building purposes   
3. The Way how DNA builds up Supra Seeded Structures,     
   that evolve to a functional Life Form,    
   no weather if viruses, bacteria, plant, fungus or animal.   
4. The way those Life forms evolve in circumstances determined by the influences of surrounding Nature.   

So we do not have a Digital Coding paradigm reusable in Genetics,  
we have a molecular structure performing on an atomic Level of physics.  
This means,  
the molecular Structures are defining the coding Process in most circumstances and  
the most further following conditions are more than ridiculous coincident,  
make DNA and RNA evolving to an alive Life form.
